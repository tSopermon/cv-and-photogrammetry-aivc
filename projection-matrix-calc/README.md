# Projection Matrix Calculation

This project contains scripts and notebooks for camera projection matrix calculation and decomposition, useful in computer vision and photogrammetry tasks.

## Structure
- `notebook/assignment.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with step-by-step implementations for projection matrix calculation, camera calibration, and error analysis using Python and OpenCV.
- `scripts/decomposecamera.m`, `scripts/rq3.m`: MATLAB scripts for camera matrix decomposition and RQ factorization.
- `doc/report.pdf`: Project report with explanations and results.

## Usage
- Run the Jupyter notebook for Python-based calculations and visualizations.
- Use the MATLAB scripts for matrix decomposition tasks.

## Requirements
- Python: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, opencv-python, scipy
- MATLAB: Standard environment

See the report for detailed methodology and results.
